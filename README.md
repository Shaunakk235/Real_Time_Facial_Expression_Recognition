# Real Time Facial Expression Detection

Facial Expression Detection is a real-time application that utilizes computer vision and deep learning techniques to recognize and classify facial expressions from live webcam feeds. By leveraging OpenCV for face detection and a pre-trained TensorFlow/Keras model for emotion recognition, this project provides an intuitive interface for understanding the emotional states of individuals captured on camera. With support for multiple emotions such as anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutrality, Facial Expression Detection offers a valuable tool for various applications including emotion analysis, user engagement monitoring, and interactive systems development.


## Installation

1.OpenCV: OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is used for face detection. You can install it using pip:

```bash
  pip install opencv-python

```
2.TensorFlow and Keras: TensorFlow and Keras are used for deep learning-based facial expression recognition. You can install them using pip:

```bash
  pip install tensorflow
  pip install keras

```
3.Download pre-trained model: Download the pre-trained model file given in the project file.
